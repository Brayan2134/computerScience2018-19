## Computer Science Projects.


This is the repository where all of my Computer Science projects live for the school year of: 2018/19. This will have the criteria for each project and what I did with it.

**NameAge**

Simple program where you just have the user input. You ask for their name, age, and gender. You store these in appropriate variables and display the data. I did above and beyond the criteria by manipulating their age and displaying their age on Jupiter.
